# Wordle-Game-with-python
 is a simple word guessing game. 
 It takes a 5-letter word as a command-line argument and allows the user to make up to 6 attempts to guess the word.
 The code checks the length of the user's input and provides feedback for each guess. If the guess is correct, the user is congratulated,
 and if the maximum number of attempts is reached without a correct guess, the correct word is revealed. The code also provides feedback 
 on the correctness and position of letters in the user's guess compared to the target word.
